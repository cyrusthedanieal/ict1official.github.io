<h1>Legazpi City </h1>
<p> Legaspi, often written Legazpi, is a Philippine chartered city located in southeast Luzon, next to an entrance on the Albay Gulf. It was named after Miguel López de Legazpi, a conqueror and the first Spanish governor-general of the Philippines, when it was founded in 1639. The city is located at the southern foot of the Mayon Volcano, an active volcano whose 1815 explosionkilled more than 1,000 people and completely destroyed the neighbouring town of Cagsawa. There is a national park on the mountain.
<br><br>
<p>The main port for an area that exports abaca and copra is Legaspi.<br> The city is the hub of a sizable abaca-fibre handcraft industry and has facilities for storing petroleum. Despite being adequately sheltered, its harbor has limited wharfage facilities because of the deep sea around its shoreline and the frequent typhoons in the area.

<h2>Daraga Church</h2>

<br><p style="margin-left: 50px;
margin-right: 50px;
margin-top: 0px;
 text-align: justify;">
Daraga Church is a rare and outstanding example of the Churrigueresque style in the Philippines.

      Developed at the height of Spanish Baroque from the late 17th to the early 18th century, the Churrigueresque style is frequently described as “Baroque on steroids” because of its florid and intricate decoration. This is mirrored in Daraga Church with the employment of Solomonic or ‘twisted” columns, floral decorations, numerous Biblical emblems, and even local geometric designs that provide a Bicolano touch to the dialogue of creative traditions. Despite being widely used in Mexico, this architectural style was just recently adopted there, which explains why it is so uncommon there. <br><br>

 text-align: justify";>
 For many years, Lignon Hill served as a PHIVOLCS observatory to monitor the volcanic activity of Mayon. Lignon Hill, however, has become one of the top tourist destinations in Legazpi, Albay since it was rebuilt and rebranded for tourism.

<br><br>It is a noticeable hill in the Philippine city of Legazpi, about 3 kilometers west of the city's central port area. The top climbs to a height of about 512 feet and offers spectacular views over both the entire city and the Albay Gulf to the east as well as the Mayon Volcano to the northwest.</p>

<br><p style="margin-left: 50px;

 text-align: justify";>
The Cagsawa Ruins are the remains of the Cagsawa Church, a Franciscan church built in the 16th century. It was primarily constructed in 1587, but it was destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1636. It was then rebuilt in 1724 by Franciscan Friars led by Father Francisco Blanco. <br><br>The Mayon Volcano experienced its most violent eruption in February 1814. Several hundred million cubic kilometers of tephra and lahar buried Cagsawa and its surrounding areas, killing approximately 1,200 people. Due to that eruption, only the belfry and some parts of the convent survived and remains today as a living testimony of that dreadful day.</p></td>
